HTTP LESSON PRELIMS

HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
	> HTTP is an application layer communication protocol that is used to access resources(hypertext/hypermedia) from the World Wide Web

	> invented by Tim Berners Lee at CERN(Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire) in 1989 together with W3C(World Wide Web Consortium) and IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force).

VERSIONS
	> HTTP 0.9 (1991)-(TCP/IP connection using port 80; "GET"; only html)

	> HTTP 1.0 (RFC(Remote Function Call) 1945, May 1996)-(pull protocol; always initiated by client)

	> HTTP 1.1 (RFC 2068 January 1997, RFC 2616 June 1999); RFC 7230-7235 June 2014

	> HTTP 2 (RFC 7540 May 2015)-(pipelining introduced; multiplexing; server push - server taking initiative)

HTTP FUNDAMENTALS

- HTTP runs on top of TCP(Transmission Control Protocol/IP(Internet Protocol) with the use of TCP port 80 by default or TCP port 443 for HTTPS(Secure HTTP)

- HTTP is based on a client-server architecture
	> Servers
		-> origin servers
		-> proxy servers, gateways, tunnels
	> Client AKA user agents(UA):
		-> web browsers, web crawlers

- HTTP uses a request-response standard protocol
	> the client send a HTTP request message to the server, the server receives the request and replies with a HTTP response message

- HTTP is a stateless communications protocol
	> servers do not keep information about clients in-between requests

- HTTP FUNCTIONALITIES:
	> cache control
	> content media type specification
	> content/transfer coding
	> content negotiation
	> client-server protocol negotiations
	> persistent connections
	> request pipelining/ multiplexing (HTTP2)
	> authorisation/authentication

HTTP 
- identified using URL's or more

	PARTS:
	> scheme (HTTP or HTTPS)
	> authority
		-> user information or authentication credentials(depreciated)
		-> host
			--> domain name
		-> port number
	> path to resonance
		-> static or dynamic resource
	> query
		-> provided as key = value pairs, with (&) separators between key/value; started with question mark
		-> may be URL-encoded; fragment identifier/ bookmark
	> fragment identifier

HTTP REQUEST MESSAGE
	> Request line (CRLF- terminated line consisting of three space separated values)
		-> method
		-> request target
		-> protocol version
	> Message Headers
	> Empty Line
	> Message Body aka payload

HTTP RESPONSE MESSAGE
	> Status line
		-> protocol version
		-> status code
		-> Reason Phrase
	> Message haders
	> Empty line
	> Message Body

HTTP REQUEST METHODS
	> Standard Methods
	> Get
		-> transfer a current selected representation of the target resource
		-> most commonly used HTTP method, supported by generation pur servers
	> Head
		-> get status line and headers without payload
		-> check status, similar to get but with no payload
	> Post
		-> request that the target resource perform resource-specific processing of the representation enclosed in the message body of the request
		-> typically used in submitting HTML form data
	> Put
		-> create or replace the state of the target resource with the state defined by the representation enclosed
	> Delete
		-> remove the association between the target resource and its current functionality
	> Options
		-> request information about the communication options available for the target resource
		-> the request target may be "*"
	> Truce
		-> request remote, application level loopback of the request message(request the recipient echo back to the client received request message)
	> Connect

		-> request establishment of a tunnel to the destination origin server and if succesful thereafter restricts its behavior to blind-formatting of products in both direction
HTTP METHOD PROPERTIES
	> Safe Methods
		-> read-only (Get, Head, Options, Truce)
	> Idempotent Methods
		-> may not be read-only, only effective once(Get, Head, Options, Truce, Put, Delete)
	> Cacheable Methods
		-> the response to a method is allowed to be stored for future reference(Get, Head, Post)
	
HTTP MESSAGE HEADER
	> General Header Fields
		-> entity header fields
	> Request Header fields

		-> more information about the resource to be get
	> Response Header Fields

		-> additional information about the response
	> Entity Header Fields(payload)

		-> information about the body of the entity

HTTP STATUS CODES
	> 3 digit code that tells the result of the operation
		-> 1XX - Information
			> 100 Continue
			> 101 Switching Protocols
		-> 2XX - Success
			> 200 OK
			> 201 Created
			> 202 Accepted
			> 203 Non-Authoritative Information
			> 204 No Content
			> 205 Reset Content
			> 206 Partial Content
		-> 3XX - Redirect
			> 300 Multiple Choices
			> 301 Moved Permanently
			> 302 Found
			> 303 See Other
			> 304 Not Modified
			> 305 Use Proxy
			> 306 (Unused and reserved)
			> 307 Temporary Redirect
		-> 4XX - Client Error
			> 400 Bad Request
			> 401 Unauthorized
			> 402 Payment Required
			> 403 Forbidden
			> 404 Not Found
			> 405 Method Not Allowed
			> 406 Not Acceptable
			> 407 Proxy Authentication
			> 408 Request Timeout
			> 409 Conflict
			> 410 Gone
			> 411 Length Required
			> 412 Precondition Failed
			> 413 Request Entity Too Large
			> 414 Request-URI Too Long
			> 415 Unsupported Media Type
			> 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable
			> 417 Expectation Failed
		-> 5XX - Server Error
			> 500 Internal Error Server
			> 501 Not Implemented
			> 502 Bad Gateway
			> 503 Service Unavailable
			> 504 Gateway Timeout
			> 505 HTTP Version Not Supported
	
HTTP Extensions
	> can be extended by defining new requests, methods, message headers and/or status codes.
