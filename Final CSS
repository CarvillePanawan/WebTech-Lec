>CSS Statements -
 a. charset - 
 b. font-face - 
 c. keyframes -
 d. media -
 
>CSS Rule Set - A CSS rule set consists of a selector and an a declaration  block which can be populated with the correct property delimited by a ' ; '(semicolon).
e.g.
    h3 {
      color: blue;
      text-align: right;
    }
    
>CSS Selectors - CSS selector is used to select a specific element or group of element based by their class,name,id, etc.
 -Selector Syntax - Chain of one or more sequences of simple selectors separated by combinators, with one pseudo-element possibly appended to the last sequence.
 eg. div #abc > p.xyz [title] + span: first_child::after
 
 -Simple Selector Sequence - 
  ->Chain of simple selectors not separated by combinators
	->Always starts with a type sector or a universal selector
	->Cannot contain other type selectors or universal selectors 
  
 -Selector Group - One or more selectors can be linked to the same declaration block.
  eg.
   h1, th {
     //declarations
   }
 -Simple Selectors - Simple selectors match elements of the document with just element type, id, or class.
 eg.
  h1 {
   color: red;
  }
 -Combinators - A combinator is utilized to specify the relationship between selectors
  -> child selector (>)
  -> adjacent sibling selector (+)
  -> descendant selector (space)
  -> general sibling selector (~)
 -Pseudo Elements - A pseudo element can be used to style a specific part of an element
 
>CSS Rule Precedence - Systematic order of execution of same property within the stylesheet.
 -Conflict Resolution
  -> 1st level - by origin and importance 
  -> 2nd level - by specifity 
  -> 3rd level - later declaration is chosen
  
>CSS Declarations - A declaration is composed of a CSS property name and value which is separated by a colon. A declaration block id delimited/
 		    sorrounded by curly braces.
  -Properties - 
   -> shorthand property - allows other to specify the rule of several properties with a single property
   -> Vendor specific extension - used by browser as a prfis for ecperimental or non-standard CSS properties
   -> custom properties(CSS Variables) - property named with -- , reperesenting a value than can be reused using the var()
   
  -Values - 
   -> Value Processing - declared > cascaded > specific > computed > used > actual
   -> Value types - 
    -- keywords
     - CSS-wide keywords(initial,inherit,actual)
     - propery-specific keywords
   -> Numbers - are integers or real numbers in decimal notation.
   -> Dimensions - Used to specify height, width, angle, time, and size of an object.

    -- length units
     - font-raelation : em,ex,ch,rem
     - viewport-percentage : vw,vh,vmin,vmax
     - absolute : cm,mm,in,pt,pc,px
    -> Angle units - can be utilized in some gradient and transform functions and used in animation,transistion, and related properties. 
     -- deg,grad,turn
    ->Duration for time units
     -- s,ms
    ->Frequency Units - Initially introduced in CSS2 for the avrol media type, reintroduced in CSS3 but is currently unused.
     -- Hz,kHz
