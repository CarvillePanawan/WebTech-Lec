 -Simple Selectors -
 
 -Combinators - 
 
 -Pseudo Elements -
 
>CSS Rule Precedence - Systematic order of execution of same property within the stylesheet.
 -Conflict Resolution
  -> 1st level - by origin and importance 
  -> 2nd level - by specifity 
  -> 3rd level - later declaration is chosen
  
>CSS Declarations -

 >CSS Preprocessor - Generate CSS using custom languages syntax typically includes feature that dont exist in pure CSS.
