                        <h2>WWW or World Wide Web</h2>
                        <p>The WWW is basically a collection of web resources and applications linked by HTTP that can be accessed through the internet.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="Hist">History</h2>
                        <p>The WWW was started by Tim Berners Lee in March 1989, it first started as a way for researchers to share and information within a wide range.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="WRes">Types of Web Resources</h2>
                        <h3>1. Static</h3>
                        <p class="move">
                        -Static resources are reources that are exaclty stored and do not require web programming and database design.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>2. Dynamic</h3>
                        <p class="move">- Dynamic resoursec are resources that are generated, usually Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or both are used.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2 id="App">Types of Applications</h2>
                        <h3>1. Client Application</h3>
                        <p class="move">- A program that can acquire or secure the services of other programs usually server appplications.</p>
                        <h3>2. Server Applications</h3>
                        <p class="move">- An application that waits for requests from other applications, whether client or server application, and sends back a response accordingly.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="URs">URL</h2>
                        <p>The URL(Uniform Resource Allocator) is the one that indicates where a web page is stored within the internet.</p>
                        <h2>URI</h2>
                        <p>A URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) is a means of identifying any kind of resource whether it be text, image and etc.</p>
                        <h2>URN</h2>
                        <p>The URN(Uniform Resoure Name) is an internet resource that is similar to the URL but instead of the location of the resource, a specific name is assigned to the resource making it easy for a person or program to find the resource. The URN is also a type of a URI.</p>
                        <h3>How it Works</h3>
                        <p class="move">Different web pages are stored or kept in web servers around the world and upon clicking a link or inpting the URL of webpage triggers a request for the web page from the web server, the server then transmits back a response containing the web page data that your web browser displays.</p>
                        
                        <h1 id="HTTP">HTTP</h1>
                        <h2>HTTP or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</h2>
                        <p>HTTP is an application layer communication protocol that is used to access resources(hypertext/hypermedia) from the World Wide Web. Invented by Tim Berners Lee at CERN(Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire) in 1989 together with W3C(World Wide Web Consortium) and IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force).</p>

                        <p>A markup language that is used in order to create websites or web applications. HTML is used to define the web page content and its layout.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="HHist">History</h2>
                        <p>On 1989, Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web (WWW) together with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) which was based on Standard Generalized Markup Lanugage (SGML). as its publishing language.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="XHTML">XHTML</h2>
                        <p>XHTML was based on HTML 4.0 that follows the Extensible Markup Lanugage (XML) rules which means XHTML can create cerain set of rules of any kind of data that can be used for describing or creating the web page layout.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="TVS">HTML 4.0 vs HTML 5 vs XHTML </h2>
                        <p>HTML 4 is the oldest version of HTML that is still used. HTML 4 has a loose syntax since having a closing tag was optional. HTML 4 is great for new developers since it is very easy to use and its very easy to adapt. HTML 4 has a disadvantage since loose syntax isnt great if you want to have an specific outcome for different browsers.</p>
                        <p>XHTML was created to fix the problem of HTML 4 being a loose syntax. In XHTML all opening tags must have a closing tags. Since XHTML is more restricted, it wont allow you to have mistakes.</p>
                        <p>HTML 5 is a new version of HTML which is still developing. HTML 5 is becoming more popular these days because of its new features. HTML 5 has also a loose syntax but it isnt a problem now since some programs that is used to create HTML auto generates a closing tags. HTML 5 still uses some of the best features of HTML 4 but it also have some new tags. One of the popular feature of HTML 5 is that you can embed videos directly without the use of plugins.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="DocuStruct">Document Structure</h2>
                        <p>HTML 4 needs to be started by a 	&#60;html&#62; tag and needs to be ended with &#60;/html&#62; tag. All other elements should appear inside &#60;html&#62; and &#60;/html&#62;. The head element is the one that appears first after the 	&#60;html&#62; tag. Inside the head,  the elements title, meta data, and script is placed together with the link of external css and some other resources that is needed. The contents of the web pages is placed inside the body elemnt. All of these are the basic structure of HTML document structure, since the HTML 5 has support from modern browsers, it is more ideal to use the new elemts to make the web pages structure more creative.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="ETVS">Elements vs Tags</h2>
                        <p>Elements are composed of a start tag (&#60;p&#62;) , a content (this is a content) and a closing tag(&#60;/p&#62;). Tags are composed of a two angle brackets and in the middle of those two angle brackets is an element name with or without attributes. </p>
