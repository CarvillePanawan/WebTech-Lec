DATATYPES
1. number
  - the datatype number can be a decimal integer, decimal floating point or a decimal scientific notation
  - you can also represent numbers with base 2,8, and 16
  - there are also special numbers which are infinity, -infinity, and NaN
  NOTE:
  Division with numbers will always result as a decimal floating point and beware of inexact result
  e.g.
  var num = 10;
  num = 1.5;
  num = 3.1e7;
2. string
  - the string datatype can be represented by a single quote ('') or a double qoute ("")
  e.g.
  var str = 'hi';
  str = "hello";
3. boolean
  - the boolean data type has two values. The first is the falsy values which is represented by false,null,0,'', and undefined. 
    The second is the truthy values which are the values other than the falsy values 
    e.g.
    var bol = false;
    bol = null;
    bol = true;
4. null and undefined
  e.g.
  var n = null;
  n = undefined;
5. Object
  - object tyoes coresponds to primitive data
  e.g.
  var obj = new String("string");
  obj = new Number(100);
  
  FUNCTIONS
  - functions in javascript lets you return any type of value you want. The parameters of a function can be any data type and it doesnt
    need to be consistent
  example of syntax:
  function fnc (a,b){
    if(a>b){
      return a;
    }else{
      return b;
    }
  }
  func(1,false);
  func("aas",null);
  
  There is an object called argument in javascript which is an array that treats the parameter of a function as a data inside the array
  example:
  function fnc1(a,b){
    console.log(argument[0]); //the output is whatever the value of a 
    console.log(argument[1]); //the output is whatever the value of b
  }
  
  There is a parameter called rest parameter which is represented by three dots (...). The rest parameter lets you have an
  indefinite number of parameter or argument in a function
  example
  function fnc2(a...b){
  }
  
 The function can also be represented as expressions
 example
 var func = function (a,b){return a/b;};
 The function can also represented as an array function
 var func1 = (a,b) => {var c = a/b; return c;};


EVENT HANDLING
Event Propagation - event propagation determines in which order the elements receive the event. There are two ways of event propagation mainly:

Capture Phase - with capturing, the first event to be captured and handled is the outermost elememt going to the innermost element.
ex. <div>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
In this example, assume that a click event happened on <li>, the order of propagation would then be from <div> to <ul> to <li>. 
Bubble Phase - with bubbling, the first event to be captured and handled is the innermost elememt going to the outermost element.
ex. <div>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
 In this example, assume that a click event happened on <li>, the order of propagation would then be from <li> to <ul> to <div>. 
 
Event Handler Registration 
- using an inline event attributes
- using addEventListener, removeEventListener, dispatchEvent
- using attachEvent, fireEvent

Event Objects Properties and Methods
- bubble
- eventPahse
- target
- current target
- preventDefault
- stopPropagation
- stopImmediatePropagation

JavaScripts API
Execution of Synchronous and Asynchronous Codes
  - JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language which means that it can only execute one statement at a time.
    Synchronous - this means that while a statement is being executed, following line of statements can't be executed.
    ex. console.log(" First ");
        console.log(" Second ");
        console.log(" Third ");
        In this example, when the statement console.log(" First "); is executed, following statements are blocked and cannot           be executed. The output should then be:
        First
        Second
        Third
    Asynchronous - this means that while a statement is being executed, the next line of codes can be executed even though         current statement are executing. It may seem that a synchronous execution is straightforward but it can really be slow.
    With asynchronous execution, things can get faster especially with image processing, file operation and others.
    ex. console.log("1");
        setTimeout( function() {
          console.log("3");
        }
        console.log("2");
        In this exmaple, we used setTimeout(), let us say that the parameters for the function is setTimeout(callback, 2000).         It has the component callback and 2000 ms, callback will let the user know if the execution is done within the time of         2 seconds. The first statement is executed then the second one which is the function setTimeout(). While it is                 executing, lines after it can be executed. After 2 seconds, callback is now triggered and the statement is now                 executed. The output should then be:
        1
        2
        3
XMLHttpRequest Object
  - with this object, updating the parts of the webpage with reloading the whole page is possible.
  - XMLHttpRequest Object is used to give and take data with a server in background.
  Some properties of this objects are:
    - status
    - statusText
    - responseText
    - responceXML
    - readyState
    - onreadystatechange
    
Promise Object
