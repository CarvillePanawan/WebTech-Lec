Servlet
  - A servelet is a Java class that is utilized to extend the capabilities of request-response programming model servers that host 
    applications. Servlets can interact or respond to any type of request, Servlets are maily used for extending applications hosted 
    by web servers.
Java Servlets
  - handles client requests by generating a response message
  - Java Servlets is hosted in a "servlet container" which is part of a web server that communicates with the servlet so that it will
    let Java to dynamically generate a web page from the server side. Servlet container also controls the servlet lifecycle
*Servlet lifecycle
1. initialization
  - The init() method will be called upon the creation of servlet and it is only called once.
2. request handling
  - Request handling is handled by the method service() which is basically the main method that handles the tasks of each request
    it uses multi-threading to do the tasks.
   - The service() method is called multiple times depending on the number of requests of the user.
3. destruction
- The destruction is handled by the method destroy() which is invoked the website? is done using the object method. 

HTTP Servlet
- used to handle HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses
- the service() method call is connected to a doXXX call (e.g. doGet(), doPost(), doPut(), doDelete())
- the doXXX() methods passes 2 arguements which are HTTPServletRequest and HTTPServletResponse

HTTPServletRequest
- used to access information from the request message

HTTPServletResponse 
- used to access information from the response message

* The web container also facilitates the conversion from HTTP response to HTTPServletResponse or from HTTP request to HTTPServletRequest.
