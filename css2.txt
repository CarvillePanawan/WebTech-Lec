CSS Selectors
-	Selector
o	Structure used as a condition in a CSS rule to determine which elements in the documentation tree are matched by the selector and are thus targeted by the formatting specified in the CSS rule declaration block.
o	The matched elements are called the subjects of the selector

o	Chain of one or more sequences of simple selectors separated by combinators, with one pseudo-element possibly appended to the last sequence.

After = pseudo-element
Span:first_child::after = pseudo-class
