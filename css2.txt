Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)
-	Language used to specify the presentation aspects (e.g. layout and formatting) of structurally marked up documents.
-	Developed by Hakom Wium Lie (CHSS) and Bert Bos (SSP)
-	Versions: 
	CSS 1 (December 1996)
	CSS 2.1 (June 2011)
	CSS 3
-	CSS Preprocessors, CSS Framework
	Sass, Less, 960 Grid System, Bootstrap, Foundation, Materialize, etc.
HTML/XHTML Stylesheet
-	Author styles
	External stylesheet (recommended)
	Uses the link element
(ref, type, href, media, title)
	Alternate stylesheet supported in firefox

	Embedded Styles
	Responsve design
	For quick prototyping
	Inline styles
-	User agent styles (example default CSS 2.1 stylesheets for HTML 4)
Style sheets may have three different origins: author, user, and user agent.
	Author. The author specifies style sheets for a source document according to the conventions of the document language. For instance, in HTML, style sheets may be included in the document or linked externally.
	User: The user may be able to specify style information for a particular document. For example, the user may specify a file that contains a style sheet or the user agent may provide an interface that generates a user style sheet (or behaves as if it did).
	User agent: Conforming user agents must apply a default style sheet (or behave as if they did). A user agent's default style sheet should present the elements of the document language in ways that satisfy general presentation expectations for the document language (e.g., for visual browsers, the EM element in HTML is presented using an italic font). Style sheets from these three origins will overlap in scope, and they interact according to the cascade.





=============================================
CSS Selectors
-	Selector
	Structure used as a condition in a CSS rule to determine which elements in the documentation tree are matched by the selector and are thus targeted by the formatting specified in the CSS rule declaration block.
	The matched elements are called the subjects of the selector
-	Selector syntax
	Chain of one or more sequences of simple selectors separated by combinators, with one pseudo-element possibly appended to the last sequence.
Example: div #abc > p.xyz [title] + span: first_child::after
>, + = contributor
After = pseudo-element
Span:first_child::after = pseudo-class
	Sequence of simple selectors
	Chain of simple selectors not separated by combinators
	Always starts with a type sector or a universal selector
	Cannot contain other type selectors or universal selectors
	Group of selectors
	Coma- separated list of selectors representing the union of all elements
e.g. h1, h2, h3
-	Simple selectors
	Type selector (p, div, span)
	Universal selector (*)
	Attribute selector
	[attr]
	[attr=value]
	[attr~=value] (class attribute)
	[attr |= value] (language attribute)
	[attr^=value] (start CSS3)
	[attr$=value] (end CSS3)
	[attr*=value] (anywhere in between CSS3)
	Class selector (<p class=”xyz”>)
	ID selector (<div id=”abc”> *for ID attribute)
	pseudo-selector
	Dynamic pseudo-class
	link pseudo-classes
: link
: visited
	user action pseudo-classes
	: hover
	: active
	: focus
	target pseudo-class
	: target (CSS3)
	language pseudo-class
	: lang()
	UI element states pseudo-class
	: enabled (CSS3)
	: disabled (CSS3)
	: checked (CSS3)
	: indeterminate (CSS3)
	structural pseudo-class
	: root
	: first-child
	: last-child
	: only-child
	: nth-child()
	: nth-last-child
	: first-of-type
	: last-of-type
	: only-of-type
	: nth-of-type()
	: nth-last-of-type()
: empty
*all CSS3 except first-child

=====================================================================

	negation
	:not (CSS3)
o	combinators
	descendant combinator (whitespace ie space, tab, line feed, carriage return, form feed)
	child combinator (>)
	sibling combinators
		adjacent sibling combinator (+)
		general sibling combinator (~) CSS3
o	pseudo-elements
	:: first-letter	, : first-letter
	:: first-line	, : first-line
	:: before	, : before
	:: after		, : after



CSS Rule Precedence
>by origin and importance
//ADDED
-Resource: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html
	Sort according to importance (normal or important) and origin (author, user, or user agent). In ascending order of precedence:
o	user agent important declarations
o	user important declarations
o	author important declarations
o	author normal declarations
o	user normal declarations
o	user agent normal declarations
	by specificity
o	inline style
o	number of ID selectors
o	number of class selectors, attribute selectors and pseudo-classes
o	number of type selectors and pseudo-elements
	by order
