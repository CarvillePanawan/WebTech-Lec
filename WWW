History
  WWW(World Wide Web) was started by Tim Berners Lee in March 1989, it first started as a way fro researchers to share and 
  information within a wide range. 
WWW
  The WWW is basiacally a collection of web resources and applications linked by HTTP that can be accessed through the internet.
  Types of Web Resources
    1. Static
      - Static resources are reources that are exaclty stored and do not require web programming and database design.
    2. Dynamic
      - Dynamic resoursec are resources that are generated, usually Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or both are
        used.
  Types of Applications
    1. Client Application
      - A program that can acquire or secure the services of other programs usually server appplications.
    2. Server Applications
      - An application that waits for requests from other applications, whether client or server application, and sends back a 
        response accordingly.
URI
  A URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) is a means of identifying any kind of resource whether it be text, image and etc.
URL
  The URL(Uniform Resource Allocator) is the one that indicates where a web page is stored within the internet. A URL is also a type of a
  URI.
URN
  The URN(Uniform Resoure Name) is an internet resource that is similar to the URL but instead of the location of the resource, a specific 
  name is assigned to the resource making it easy for a person or program to find the resource. The URN is also a type of a URI.
How it Works
  Different web pages are stored or kept in web servers around the world and upon clicking a link or inputing the URL of webpage 
  triggers a request for the web page from the web server, the server then transmits back a response containing the web page data 
  that your web browser displays.
